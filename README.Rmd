# Setup

This project is going to require growth data from a number of years during childhood, as well as epigenetic age data during young adulthood (20-22 years old) for about 500 individuals. (We have more data coming, but this is going to lay the foundation for the larger analysis). 

Data about growth can be accessed at the [UNC Dataverse](https://dataverse.unc.edu/dataverse/cebu)


We're going to need: 

* Only live births
* Data about growth (birth weight, length, skinfolds if we have them)
* Birthday (for age)
*
